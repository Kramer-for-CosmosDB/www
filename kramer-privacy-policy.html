                    As an internet client submitting user input (e.g. SQL queries) to a remote server, Kramer does
                    not attempt to filter or restrict the user from entering personal information. Users are
                    responsible for data entered into and transmitted via Kramer. Kramer makes no gaurantees 
                    about the service located at the user-configured endpoint.
